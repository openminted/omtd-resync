= ResourceSync server

=== Overview
ResourceSync is a synchronization framework for the web consisting of various
capabilities that allow third-party systems to remain synchronized with a
server's evolving resources. It is based on the Sitemaps protocol, extending
its capabilities in order to keep track of resources' state.

The purpose of our work is to develop a fully compliant, reliable and scalable
implementation of a ResourceSync server that can allow the Data Interoperability
Toolkit to expose metadata and full-text resources downloaded from publishers
overtime.

=== Requirements
. Maximizing response time to resync requests
. Managing separate sets of resources belonging to different data providers
. Optimization for continuous additions and occasional deletes/updates
. Dealing with sitemaps limitations (max 50k items/document, max 50MB)
. Metadata and content files related to a publication should be linked

=== Architecture

=== ElasticSearch
* Resource state will be kept into ElasticSearch indexes. For each resource,
we will store metadata that will be showed in sitemaps docs (last mod, hash,
  size, etc)
* Whenever a new ResourceList has to be generated, its pagination will come
directly from the ElasticSearch index, and each xml document will be cached and
regenerated after a given amount of detected changes
* When a change in the folder is detected, the event will be registered into
ElasticSearch, in a way that a ChangeList related to a given period of time
will be generated taking into account the events occurred in that time interval.
 ChangeList caching will be implemented as well.
* Periodically, a new ResourceList will be generated and the current ChangeList
will be “closed”, therefore a new ChangeList will be initialized. There is no
indication for the appropriate time interval in the ResourceSync specification,
so we will tune this parameter based on the metadata/pdfs download rate.

=== Further improvements
* Push protocol based on PubSubHubbub
** Change Notification
*** Notifies about changes to particular resources e.g.,
resource A has been updated | created | deleted
** Framework Notification
*** Notifies about changes to capabilities e.g.,
a Change List has been updated | created | deleted
* Resources and Changes dumps
